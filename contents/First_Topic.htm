    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>Application Overview</h2>
    <p>User Management application is used to define and control which types of users can utilize applications in the system and their features and how permissions are given to them to control access to features in applications.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>This guide is mostly designed for Administrators to provide necessary information required in User Management, granting access control to each user in the system, designing reports and etc.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>User Management Application in a Nutshell</h3>
    <ul class="Disc">
      <li>User Management application is a base app in iviva, which is used for managing system users in the entire system.</li>
      <li>User Management is critical as it is used for maintaining a secure system without ineffective user and access management.</li>
      <li>The User Management App is mostly utilized by Administrators to configure and manage users in the system and to configure users’ access rights to applications in the system.</li>
      <li>Before start configuring the <strong>System Users</strong>, the Admin shall configure <strong>Custom User Types</strong>, <strong>User Roles</strong> and <strong>User Groups</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>User Type</strong> is a category that is used to group users according to the job or task they perform. e.g. Administrator, Technician</li>
      <li><strong>User Types</strong> are divided into two groups namely Default User Type and <strong>Custom User Types</strong>.</li>
      <li>The User Types that are configured under each App fall into the Default User Type category.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom User Type</strong> is a group that categorizes the User Types that are configured by the users in User App.</li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>User Role</strong> is a set of access rights granted to a subset of System Users that restrict the access to operations in each application.</span></li>
      <li><strong>User Group</strong> is used to configure a group containing common features and User Roles for Apps. This makes the work efficient as the admin does not need to add each and every feature and User roles to Users, when configuring them. Once the relevant <strong>User Group</strong> is selected, all features of selected will be applied to the respective User.</li>
      <li>The most important operation in User Management App is configuring System Users and assigning User Roles to them and thereafter managing the users.</li>
    </ul>
